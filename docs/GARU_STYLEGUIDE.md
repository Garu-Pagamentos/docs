### Writing Principles

**Be Clear Over Clever**
Use straightforward language. Avoid jargon unless your audience demands it.

**Show, Don't Tell**
Instead of claiming excellence, demonstrate it through action and results.

**Focus on the User**
Use "you" language. Keep the entrepreneur's journey central to all messaging.

**Be Specific**
Avoid vague promises. Specify what Garu does and how it helps.

**Use Active Voice**
"Garu processes payments instantly" rather than "Payments are processed by Garu."

**Include a Call to Action**
Every piece of communication should move the user toward the next step.

### Examples of Garu's Voice

**Good:** "Your payments, managed your way. No complications, just results."  
(Clear, action-oriented, focused on user benefit)

**Better Avoided:** "Garu provides sophisticated payment gateway infrastructure with industry-leading uptime metrics."  
(Too formal, too technical, too self-focused)
